      "Last year, I attended Tesvan's QA course in Sevan, and it was a fantastic experience! Over the span of four months, I went from learning the basics of QA to mastering QA automation. The hands-on approach made the learning process enjoyable and practical. Plus, the teaching team was super friendly and supportive throughout the entire course. Yes, it was an invaluable experience that I'm grateful for!",
